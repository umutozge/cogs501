Quiz 09 (22/4) - COGS 501/Spring 2024
------------------------------------

1. **[5/10]** Given a deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing a
   card that is red or non-face? (All cards except Js, Qs and Ks are non-face.) 

   ------------
   **Solution**

   There are 26 red, 40 non-face and 20 red and non-face cards in the deck. The
   answer, therefore, is $46/52$. You can also count face black cards, which is
   6, and subtract it from 52, getting the same answer. Forgetting the division
   by 52 will cost you **2pts**.

1. **[5/10]** A machine randomly generates bit strings of length 10. The
   generations are independent. What is the probability that the next random bit
   string contains more 1's than 0's and starts with a 0.

   -----------
   **Solution**

   You need to count bit strings of length 9 which has at least 6 1's. There are
   $\binom{9 6} + \binom{9 7} + \binom{9 8} + \binom{9 9}$ such strings. If you
   subtract this from the total number of 10 digit bit strings, and divide the result
   by number of 10 digit bit strings, you will get the answer, which is $\frac{2^{10}
   - \binom{9 6} + \binom{9 7} + \binom{9 8} + \binom{9 9}}{2^{10}}$.



1. ðŸ’Ž **3pts** What is the probability that a randomly dealed poker hand with 5
   cards has the ace of spades?

   ---------------
   **Solution**
  
   $\frac{\binom{52}{5} - \binom{51}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}}$
