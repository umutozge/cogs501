COGS 501 Session 05
-------------------

### Reading
* Epp 3.2-3
* CP 1.5.1-3

### First-order logic

* Express the following in FOL:
   1. Everyone has a mother.
      * M(x, y): "y is the mother of x"
   2. Some students in this class have taken COGS 501.
      * S(x): "x is a student in this class"
      * T(x): "x has taken COGS 501"
   3. There is a person who loves everyone.
      * L(x, y): "x loves y"
      * P(x): "x is a person"
   4. No sample is contaminated.
      * S(x): "x is a sample"
      * C(x): "x is contaminated"
   5. Every person who loves all animals is a vegetarian.
      * L(x, y): "x loves y"
      * A(y): "y is an animal"
      * V(x): "x is a vegetarian"
   6. All students in this class who have taken COGS 501 love some programming language.
      * L(x, y): "x loves y"
      * P(y): "y is a programming language"
   7. There is a smallest positive integer.
   8. There is no smallest positive real number.

* Give example models that satisfy the following formulas:
   1.  $\forall x\exists y\\;(P(x,y) \land Q(x,y))$
   2.  $\exists x\forall y\;(P(x,y)\rightarrow Q(x,y))$
   3.  $\forall x\;(P(x)\lor\exists y\;Q(x,y))$
   4. $\exists x\;(P(x)\land\forall y\;Q(x,y))$

### Programming
* `print` as a non-pure function.
* The function of `return` in a function.
* Simple versus compound statements.
* Multiple step functions with `profit` example.
* Sequence of statements and control.
* Boolean type.
* `if` over `myabs`.
* `and` and `or`.
* Iteration with `while` (Fibonacci).
