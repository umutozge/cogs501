#### Reading
* Stavely Ch. 4

#### Checklist 
* Make sure you can write your own functions.
* Always try to write functions that do a single task. If this advice is not
    clear to you, think about it more until it becomes clear.
* Whenever you see or write a function, make sure you know what types of
    argument are taken and what type of result (if any) is returned.
* Do your best to understand everything in the chapter. But, if recursion,
    functions as values, and lambda functions are not absolutely clear, don't
    worry. We will discuss them in class in detail.
