#### Reading
* No reading, just coding...

#### Checklist 
* In order to use Python's `reduce`, put the line `from functools import reduce`
    to the top of your program file. You can now run `reduce` by two arguments
    or three arguments. The third argument will be your initial value.
* Reverse a list using `reduce`. Yes, `reduce`. Put the line `from random import
* randint` to the top of your program file to
    use `randint`, which takes two arguments and generates a random integer in
    this (inclusive) range.
* Use `randint` to define a function which takes a list `aset` that represents a
 set and an integer `n` smaller
    than or equal to the size of the list, and returns a random subset of `lst`
    with size `n`. 
* Define a function that takes a string as input and returns a random
    permutation of the input string. A random permutation of a string is the
    same size string where the characters may appear in positions different than
    in the input string.
* Now you have your own sorting function (last week's checklist item). Use that
    function to define a function that takes a list as argument and returns the
    sequences of indices that represents the sorted order of the input list. For
    instance, the input `[2,1,4]` must return `[1,0,2]`.
* If you want to progress in programming, try solving the above problems without
    consulting any resource other than what we have seen in class and readings
    so far.
