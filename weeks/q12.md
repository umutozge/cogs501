------------------------------------

1. **[5/10]** What is the probability of two people chosen at random were born on the same day of the week, assuming no birthday is more probable than the others. 

    ----------------------

    **Solution**

    $1/7$
    ----------------------
    

1. **[5/10]** Suppose that one person in 10,000 has a rare genetic disease. There is a test for the disease where 99.9% of the people with the disease test positive and only 0.02% of who do not have the disease test positive. What is the probability that someone who tested positive has the disease?  
   

    ----------------------

    **Solution**

    Symolize as:

    $P$ test positive 
    $D$ has the disease

    What is the unknown?

    $p(D|P)$

    What are given?

    $p(D) = 0.0001$
    $p(P|D) = 0.999$
    $p(P|\neg D) = 0.0002$

    Given that:

    $$ p(D|P) = \frac{p(D)p(P|D)}{p(D)p(P|D) + p(\neg D)p(P|\neg D)}$$ 
  
    substitute the givens:

    $$ p(D|P) = \frac{0.0001\times 0.999}{0.0001\times 0.999 + 0.9999\times 0.0002} = 0.333 $$

    When someone tests positive with the test, then there is $33\%$ chance that
    s/he has the disease.


    **Calculation errors will not cost any credit, but the formula(tion) must be
    correct.**

1. ðŸ’Ž  Assume that the probability of a child be a boy is 0.51. What is the probability of a family with five children to have all children of same sex? (**1pt**) What is the probability of exactly 3 boys? (**1pt**)  


    ----------------------

    **Solution**

    All same: $0.51^5 + 0.49^5$

    Exactly 3 boys: $\binom{5}{3}\cdot 0.51^3\cdot 0.49^2$
