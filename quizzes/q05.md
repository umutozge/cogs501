Quiz (30/10) - COGS 501
------------------------------------
1. **[2pts]** Define the Collatz function in Python.

   **Solution:**

   ```python
   def Collatz(n):
       print(n)
       while n != 1:
           if n % 2 == 0:
               n = n // 2
           else:
               n = 3*n + 1
           print(n)
   ```
   
2. **[4pts]** Define a function that takes an integer `n` greater than or equal to
   1, and returns the number of times one encounters a number that exceeds `n`
   while reducing `n` to 1 by the Collatz function.

   **Solution:**
   ```python
   def col_exceeds(n):
       count = 0
       n1 = n # This is our original n

       while n != 1:
           if n > n1: # If the number is larger than our original n, we add 1 to our count.
               count += 1
           # The part below is the same as the regular Collatz function.
           if n % 2 == 0:
               n = n/2
           else:
               n = 3*n + 1

       print(count) # Here we print how many we counted within the while loop.
   ```
   
4. ðŸ¤‘ **[4pts]** One way to decide whether a positive integer `m` is divisible by another
   positive integer `n` is to repeatedly subtract `n` from `m` until you arrive at `0` or
   a negative integer. If you reached `0` then, `m` is divisible by `n`; if you
   skipped `0` and arrived at a negative integer, then `m` is not divisible by
   `n`. Define a recursive function that takes `m` and `n` as arguments and
   returns `1` if `m` is divisible by `n` and returns `0` otherwise. (A
   non-recursive solution gets the half.)

   **Solution:**
   ```python
   def divisible(m, n):
       if (m - n) < 1:
           if (m - n) == 0:
               print(1)
           else:
               print(0)
       else:
           divisible((m - n), n)
   ```
