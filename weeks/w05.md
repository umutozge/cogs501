**(5pts)** Collatz' conjecture conjectures that no matter which integer you start
with, by successively applying the following function you will eventually end up
with 1.

$$
C(n) =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } n \leq 1 \\
n/2, & \text{if }n\text{ is even}\\
3n+1, & \text{if }n\text{ is odd}\\
\end{cases}
$$

Write a `racket` program that takes as input an integer; draws a circle of the size of the input on
the center; updates the image in every tick of the clock
by changing its size to the next Collatz' value. The program must stop
when the updated number reaches 1. Assume that you will never be given an
integer less than 1. Note that you can slow down the clock by giving a second
parameter to the `on-tick` function of `big-bang`, which will make the clock
tick at that many second intervals. In the end you are expected to observe a
circle going smaller and larger continuously as the Collatz' function tries to
converge to 1. (In case you want to deal with very large numbers, you will need
to scale them down, since you might exceed the maximum canvas size.)


Submit your solution as a `rkt` file. The main function of your program must be
named `main`.

**Solution**

```racket
(require 2htdp/universe)
(require 2htdp/image)

(define BACKGROUND (empty-scene 100 100))

(define (draw-circle s)
  (place-image (circle s "solid" "red") 50 50 BACKGROUND))

(define (coll-next n)
  (if (even? n)
      (/ n 2)
      (+ (* 3 n) 1)))

(define (stop? n)
  (= 1 n))

(define (main start-state)
  (big-bang start-state
    [to-draw draw-circle]
    [on-tick coll-next 1]
    [stop-when stop?]))
```
