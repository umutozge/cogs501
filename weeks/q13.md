------------------------------------

1. **[5/10]** Given a process which consists of two independent tosees of a biased coin ($p(H)=3/4$) and let $X$ be the
   raondom variable that maps the outcomes of this process to the number of $H$s they contain. What is the expected value of $X$? 

   --------------------------

   **Solution**

   $$E(X)= (\frac{3}{4})^2\cdot2 + \binom{2}{1}\cdot\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{4}\cdot 1 + (\frac{1}{4})^2\cdot 0= \frac{24}{16}=\frac{3}{2}$$

1. **[5/10]** What is the expected sum of the numbers that appear when three fair dice are rolled? 

   --------------------------

   **Solution**

   In order to make calculations simpler, define three random variables $X_1,
   X_2, X_3$, such that they map an outcome (i.e. a triple) to the first, second
   and the third components, respectively. In other words $X=X_1, + X_2 + X_3$.

   $$E(X_1) = E(X_2) = E(X_3) = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)\cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{21}{6}$$

   therefore,

   $$E(X)= 3\cdot\frac{21}{6}=10.5$$
