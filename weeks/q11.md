Quiz 11 (6/5) - COGS 501/Spring 2024
------------------------------------

1. **[5/10]** What is the conditional probability that exactly 4 heads appear
   when a fair coin is filliped five times, given that the first flip came up
   tails? 

   -----------------

   **Solution**

   Given that the first flip is T, the size of our sample space becomes
   $2^4=16$. Only one of these possibilities fulfills our event description,
   therefore the answer is $1/16$. 

   -----------------

1. **[5/10]** Two fair dice are rolled and the result is recorded. You learn
   that at least one of the dice came up 6. What is the conditional probability
   that the sum of the dice is 7, given this information.

   -----------------

   **Solution**

   Now the size of the sample space is $36-25=11$. 36 is the unconditional
   sample space size, and 25 is the number of possible rolls which do not have
   at least one 6, i.e. 5 possible outcomes for each die. Out of this 11, only
   $(6,1)$ and $(1,6)$ our of our interest. Therefore, the answer is $2/11$.
   
   -----------------

1. ðŸ’Ž **3pts** In a randomly picked permutation of 26 letters in the English
   Alphabet, what is the probability that the first 13 letters of the
   permutation is in alphabetical order. 

   -----------------

   **Solution**
    
   $1/13!$ Assume I told you that I picked a sequence of 10 letters from the
   English alphabet at random. As for the order of the sequence, there is 10!
   possiblities, only one of which would be in alphabethical order. The case at
   hand is exactly like this.
