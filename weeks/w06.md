`ðŸ“† 25/3`

### Math:

* Read Section 1.4 (Levin).
* Anxiolytic: Be well-prepared to answer questions that ask you to count
  functions with certain properties. You are not required to memorize the names
  of the properties, but make sure you understand the property itself.
  Also expect a second counting question. All based on either the readings or the
  lectures.


### Programming:

Read Section 3.1. It examplifies the  [function design
recipe](https://htdp.org/2023-8-14/Book/part_preface.html#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3athe-design-recipe%29%29)
of the book. This may appear unnecessary (if not utterly silly) at the moment.
But please do bear with me, you will benefit from it immensely in the -- not so
far -- future. There will also be a tiny programming assignment.   

### Assignment

**(3pts)** Design an implement a function that computes $\binom{n}{r}$. Closely follow the recipe given in the reading.[^1]


[^1] We will assign points to the assignments according to their difficulty (= time required to solve it). The previous weeks assignment is **5pt**. As in quizzes, there will be bonuses for you to make up for your losses.
