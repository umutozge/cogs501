#### Quiz (9/10) -- COGS 501/Fall 2024

1. **[1 pt]** Explain what “relation” and “function” (“mapping”) mean and how they differ.

**Solution:**
A relation associates some or all members of a set (the domain) with some or all members of an another set (the codomain). The relation can also be empty. A function associates every member of a set (the domain) with only one member of an another set (the codomain). In a relation, a member of the domain can be associated with zero or more (even multiple) members of the codomain while in a function, it has to be associated with only one member of the codomain.

2. **[2 pts]** Remember the script that finds the names starting with “John”. Complete the dotted lines in the script so that your program prints how many people there are named “John” in the list. Names like “Johnson” should not be counted.

```python
file = open("names.txt")
lines = file.readlines()
………………………

………………………
  if …………………
     ……………………

print(…………)
```

**Solution:**
```python
file = open("names.txt")
lines = file.readlines()
count = 0

for line in lines:
  if line.startswith("John ")
     count += 1

print(count)
```
