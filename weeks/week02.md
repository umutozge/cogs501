#### Requirements

* There should be no problem with the programming reading. But you might find some stuff in the mathematics reading difficult. Go through all the points and exercises. Note the areas where you had difficulty. We will discuss them in class.
* The quiz will test whether you went through the material or not. You are not supposed to understand all the examples in the math part. And you will have time to ask and discuss unclear points before the quiz.
