#### Reading
* No reading, just coding...

#### Checklist 
* Given 5 integers find the maximum and minimum numbers that can be
    obtained by multiplying exactly 4 of these. (Achtung! integers can be
    negative.)
* Given a string return the three most frequently occuring characters in
    descending order. If two characters occur at the same frequency, sort them
    alphabetical descending order. The input `aabbbccde` must return
    `[(b,3),(a,2),(c,2))]`.
* Given a list of integers where each element except one occurs exactly twice.
    Find the unique element that occurs `n` time, where `n != 2`.
* A string is a `pangram` if it contains all the elements in the reference
    language. For instance a popular English tangram is: `The quick brown fox
    jumps over the lazy dog`. Define a function `pangram` that takes a string
    and returns `True` if the string is a `pangram` and `False` otherwise.
    Parametrize the language choice and implement your program as capable of
    detecting English or Turkish pangrams.
* Hunt for Turkish or English pangrams on the web.
