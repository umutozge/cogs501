<blockquote class="mathbox definition" id="def:gcd">
  <p><strong>Definition</strong> (greatest common divisor) <br /><br />
Given two integers \(a\) and \(b\), the <strong>greatest common divisor</strong> (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\), denoted by \(\gcd(a,b)\), is the largest integer that divides both \(a\) and \(b\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Euclid’s algorithm (300 BC) which computes the GCD of two positive integers is one of the oldest algorithms still useful today.</p>

<p>The algorithm for computing GCD of \(a\) and \(b\), where \(a&gt;b\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>To compute \(gcd(a,b)\):
    <ul>
      <li>Let \(r = a\bmod b\);</li>
      <li>if \(r = 0\), then the answer is \(b\).</li>
      <li>else, the answer is \(gcd(b,r)\).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This simple yet ingenious algorithm may not be easy to understand without examples.<sup id="fnref:euc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:euc" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Take the numbers 48 and 18.</p>

\[48 = 2 \times 18 + 12\]

<p>As the remainder is not 0, we repeat the process with 18 and 12:</p>

\[18 = 1 \times 12 + 6\]

<p>One more time with 12 and 6:</p>

\[12 = 2 \times 6 + 0\]

<p>As the remainder is now 0, we can stop. The GCD of 48 and 18 is therefore 6.</p>

<p>Another quick example: what is the GCD of 476 and 272? The answer is 68, as we can see from the following steps:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
476 &amp; = 1 \times 272 + 204 \\
272 &amp; = 1 \times 204 + 68 \\
204 &amp; = 3 \times 68 + 0
\end{align*}\]

<p>So much for <em>how</em> the algorithm works. But <em>why</em> does it work?</p>

<p>The critical observation is that the GCD of any \(a\) and \(b\), with \(a&gt;b\), is the same as the GCD of \(b\) and the remainder of dividing \(a\) by \(b\). In a concise and more formal way, we can state this as:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\forall a,b,r\in \mathbb{Z} \text{ s.t. } a&gt;b, gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,a \bmod b)
\label{gcdequal}
\end{align}\]

<p>Why is \eqref{gcdequal} true?</p>

<p>We will see two proofs of \eqref{gcdequal}, both correct. You decide which one is “better”.</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox proof" id="proof:gcd-euclid-1">
  <p><strong>Proof</strong> (\eqref{gcdequal}, version 1):<br />
Let’s say \(gcd(a,b)=g\), we want to show that \(gcd(b,r)=g\), where \(r=a \bmod b\).
We can think of this task as two sub-tasks: (1) show that \(g\) divides both \(b\) and \(r\), and (2) show that any other common divisor of \(b\) and \(r\) cannot be larger than \(g\).<br />
First part: <br /></p>
  <ol>
    <li>As \(gcd(a,b)=g\), then \(g\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), and we can write \(a=mg\) and \(b=ng\) for some integers \(m,n\).<br /></li>
    <li>Let \(r=a \bmod b\), which means \(a=kb+r\), and therefore \(r=a-kb\) for some integer \(k\).<br /></li>
    <li>Replace \(a,b\) with \(mg,ng\) respectively in the equation for \(r\) to get \(r=mg-k(ng)=g(m-kn)\).<br /></li>
    <li>As \(m-kn\) is an integer, we can conclude that \(r\) is divisible by \(g\).<br /></li>
    <li>We already know that \(g\mid b\), therefore \(g\) is a common divisor of \(b\) and \(r\).<br /></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Second part:<br /></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Assume that there is another common divisor of \(b\) and \(r\), call it \(h\), where \(h &gt; g\).<br /></li>
    <li>First, \(h\nmid a\), because otherwise \(h\) becomes a common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) larger than their GCD \(g\), which is a contradiction.<br /></li>
    <li>As \(h\) divides both \(b\) and \(r\), we can write \(b=ph\) and \(r=qh\) for some integers \(p,q\).<br /></li>
    <li>Replace \(b\) and \(r\) in the equation \(a=kb+r\) with \(ph\) and \(qh\), respectively. We get \(a=k(ph)+qh=h(kp+q)\), which in turn means \(h\mid a\), given that \(kp+q\) is guaranteed to be an integer. Again we contradicted ourselves.<br /></li>
    <li>Therefore \(b\) and \(r\) cannot have a common divisor larger than \(g\), completing the proof<br /></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a slightly different proof. In this we will not proceed over the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) directly, but prove that the set of common divisors of \(a\) and \(b\) is the same with the set of common divisors of \(b\) and \(r\). As the GCD is defined as the largest common divisor, if the two sets are the same, their GCDs must be the same as well.</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox proof" id="proof:gcd-euclid-2">
  <p><strong>Proof</strong> (\eqref{gcdequal}, version 2):<br />
Let \(A = \lbrace x: x\mid a, x\mid b \rbrace\) and \(B = \lbrace y: y\mid b, y\mid r \rbrace\) be the sets of common divisors of \(a\) and \(b\), and \(b\) and \(r\), respectively. We want to show that \(A = B\).<br />
First show \(A \subseteq B\):<br />
Pick any \(g\in A\), then by the exact same steps in the earlier proof, you deduce \(g\mid b\) and \(g\mid r\), and therefore \(g\in B\).<br />
Second show \(B \subseteq A\):<br />
Pick any \(h\in B\), then by the exact same steps in the earlier proof, you deduce \(h\mid a\) and \(h\mid b\), and therefore \(h\in A\).<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, there is an air of elegance in the second proof, in the sense that it does not resort to proof by contradiction.</p>

<p>Having proved \eqref{gcdequal},  we now know that we can reduce the problem of finding GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) to finding GCD of \(b\) and \(r\). To complete the picture for now, we will count on our intuition, without a rigorous proof,<sup id="fnref:converge" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:converge" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> that repeating this process will eventually lead us to a remainder of 0, at which point the other number is the GCD.</p>

<p>We do not start from the absolute beginning. We take for granted integers and arithmetic operations. We start by some terminology.
The set of integers, denoted by \(\mathbb{Z}\), is the set of whole numbers including negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. When we say <strong>positive integers</strong> – aka <strong>natural numbers</strong> – we exclude zero and, obviously, negative integers. The set of positive integers is denoted by \(\mathbb{Z}^+\). If you want to include zero but leave out negative integers, the term is <strong>non-negative integers</strong>. The set of non-negative integers is denoted by \(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\), and so on with other subscripts. When we say number we will mean integer unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p>The two foundational concepts of number theory are <strong>divisibility</strong> and  <strong>parity</strong> (i.e. even v. odd). The former is more primitive, in the sense that once we define divisibility, we can use this definition to define parity. Here we go:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox definition" id="def:div">
  <p><strong>Definition 1</strong> (divisibility) <br /><br />
An integer \(a\neq 0\) <strong>divides</strong> another integer \(b\), denoted by \(a \mid b\), if there exists an integer \(k\) such that \(b = ka\). We say \(a\) is a <strong>divisor</strong> (or <strong>factor</strong>) of \(b\), and \(b\) is a <strong>multiple</strong> of \(a\). <br /><br />
If \(a\) does not divide \(b\), we write \(a \nmid b\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="notice--warning"><strong>Check</strong> Express divisibility in first-order logic.</p>

<p>Here is the Division Algorithm, which is actually not an algorithm but a theorem:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox theorem" id="thm:division-algorithm">
  <p><strong>Theorem</strong> (Division Algorithm) <br /><br />
Given any integers \(a\) and \(b\) with \(b&gt;0\), there are unique integers \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r &lt; b\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some more terminology:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox definition" id="def:quotient-remainder">
  <p><strong>Definition</strong> (quotient and remainder) <br /><br />
In the equality of the Division Algorithm, \(a\) is the <strong>dividend</strong>, \(b\) is the <strong>divisor</strong>, \(q\) is the <strong>quotient</strong> and \(r\) is the <strong>remainder</strong>. Other notations for quotient and remainder are \(q = a\; \mathrm{div}\;  b\) and \(r = a \bmod b\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quotient of dividing \(a\) by \(b\) can be expressed by the floor function which given a number (not necessarily integer) returns the largest integer not greater than that number. For example, \(\lfloor 3.7 \rfloor = 3\), \(\lfloor -2.3 \rfloor = -3\), and so on. Using the floor function, we can express the quotient as \(q = \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor\).</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><strong>Check:</strong> What is the quotient and remainder when -11 is divided by 3?</p>

<p>If you answered the above incorrectly as ‘quotient is -3 and remainder is -2’, on the grounds that \(-11=-3\times3 -2\), you have to re-read <a href="#thm:division-algorithm">Theorem (Division Algorithm)</a>.</p>

<p class="notice--success"><strong>Programming note:</strong> In Python, the floor division operator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">//</code> computes the quotient, while the modulo operator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> computes the remainder.</p>

<p>The infinite set \(\mathbb{Z}\) can be partitioned into two infinite subsets: <strong>even</strong> and <strong>odd</strong> integers. Partitioning means when you take the union of even integers and odd integers you get back to \(\mathbb{Z}\), while their intersection is the empty set. In more simple terms, if you are an integer, then you are either odd or even, you cannot be both, and you cannot be anything else. We define these sets:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox definition" id="def-even-odd">
  <p><strong>Definition 2</strong> (parity) <br /><br />
\(\begin{align}
\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}, n \text{ is even iff }  2\mid n \\
\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}, n \text{ is odd iff } 2\nmid n
\end{align}\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words  “\(n\) is even” and “\(2 \mid n\)” are the two ways, the latter being more symbolic, to say the same thing. (Isn’t what I just wrote is the definition of definition?)</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><strong>Check:</strong> According to our definition of parity, do we treat 0 as even, odd, or neither?</p>

<p>Given \(n\in \mathbb{Z}\), the set \(\lbrace x : x\mid n\rbrace\) is named the <strong>divisors</strong> of \(n\).<sup id="fnref:divisors" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:divisors" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote class="mathbox definition" id="def:proper">
  <p><strong>Definition 2</strong> (proper divisors) <br /><br />

</blockquote>

<p class="notice--warning"><strong>Check:</strong> What are the proper divisors of 12? What about -12?</p>

<p>Here is the standard definition of prime numbers:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox definition" id="def:prime">
  <p><strong>Definition 3</strong> (prime) <br /><br />
A positive integer \(p &gt; 1\) is called a <strong>prime number</strong> (or simply is <strong>prime</strong>) if its only positive divisors are 1 and \(p\) itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you think of an alternative definition of prime numbers using the concept of proper divisors we just defined?</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox definition" id="def:prime-alt">
  <p><strong>Definition</strong> (prime – alternative) <br /><br />
A positive integer \(p &gt; 1\) with no proper divisor other than 1 is called a <strong>prime number</strong> (or simply is <strong>prime</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is another one that does not need \(&gt;1\) condition:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox definition" id="def:prime-alt3">
  <p><strong>Definition</strong> (prime – alternative 3) <br /><br />
A positive integer \(p\) that has exactly 2 divisors is <strong>prime</strong>..</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="mathbox definition" id="def:composite">
  <p><strong>Definition</strong> (composite numbers) <br /><br />
A positive integer \(n &gt; 1\) that is not prime is <strong>composite</strong>.
Or, equivalently,<br /> \(\forall n &gt;1, n \text{ is composite iff } \exists z \text{ s.t. } z\mid n \text{ and } 1 &lt; z &lt; n\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much for definitions. Let’s now look at some truths we can prove using these definitions. The technical name for such truths is <strong>theorems</strong>. Here is a theorem about parity:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox theorem" id="thm:odd-square">
  <p><strong>Theorem 1</strong> <br /><br />
For any integer \(n\), if \(n\) is odd, then \(n^2\) is odd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a proof:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox proof" id="proof:odd-square">
  <p><strong>Proof 1</strong> (Theorem 1)<br /><br />
Given that \(n\) is odd, \(n = 2k + 1\) for some integer \(k\).<br /> Then, \(n^2 = (2k +1) (2k +1) = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\).<br /> Since \(2k^2 + 2k\) is an integer, we can say that \(n = 2p + 1\) for some integer \(p=2k^2 + 2k\), and therefore we can conclude that \(n^2\) is odd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks reasonable. But it is not reasonable. We made use of two “truths” that we have not defined or proved yet: (1) any odd number \(n\) equals \(2k + 1\) for some integer \(k\), and (2) if \(a\) and \(b\) are integers, so are \(a+b\) and \(ab\). To make our proof rigorous, we need to avoid using any unproven statements and undefined terms.</p>

<p>We will first take the following theorem for granted without proving it:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox theorem" id="thm:closure">
  <p><strong>Theorem 2</strong> (closure)<br /><br />
The set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) is closed under addition, multiplication and subtraction. In other words, for any \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(a + b, ab, a-b \in \mathbb{Z}\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="notice--warning"><strong>Check:</strong> Why is \(\mathbb{Z}\) not closed under division?</p>

<p>Now let us prove this very useful theorem about odd numbers:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox theorem" id="thm:odd-numbers">
  <p><strong>Theorem 3</strong> (odd numbers)<br /><br />
For any integer \(n\), \(n\) is odd iff there exists an integer \(k\) such that \(n = 2k + 1\).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="mathbox proof" id="proof:odd-square">
  <p><strong>Proof:</strong> (Theorem 3)<br /><br />
Let \(n\) be odd.<br />
By the division algorithm, there exist integers \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(n = 2q + r\) and \(0 \leq r &lt; 2\).<br />
\(r\) can either be 0 or 1. If \(r\) is 0, then \(n = 2q\), which means \(2 \mid n\), contradicting the assumption that \(n\) is odd.<br />
Therefore, \(r=1\), and \(n = 2q + 1\).<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With Theorem 3 proved, we can now complete the proof of Theorem 1:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox proof" id="proof:odd-square">
  <p><strong>Proof</strong> (Theorem 1)<br /><br />
Let \(n\) be odd.<br />
Then \(n = 2k +1\) for some \(k\) by Theorem 3<br />
Then, \(n^2 = (2k +1) (2k +1) = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\).<br /> Since \(2k^2 + 2k\) is an integer by Theorem 2, we can say that \(n = 2p + 1\) for some integer \(p=2k^2 + 2k\)<br />
Therefore we can conclude that \(n^2\) is odd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s exercise a little more.</p>

<p>I think all of us know the basic facts about divisibility: a number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is divisible by 2 (i.e. even), likewise for 5, and more interestingly, a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. It is quite straightforward to convince ourselves of the correctness of the first two facts, but why should the third hold? All of us know <em>that</em> it holds, but only some of us might know <em>why</em> it holds. Knowing that some fact holds can be very useful, in engineering, finance, medical practice, sports, and so on. But in science and mathematics, <em>knowing that</em> is secondary to <em>knowing why</em>.</p>

<p>Give yourself some time to think about why the divisibility rule for 3 holds.</p>

<p>Some of us will see it, perhaps, right away, some will need more time, some will progress only up to a certain point, and some will not even find that initial <em>handle</em> to grasp so that they can start reasoning. The biggest mistake for those who are not happy with their performance (which means all levels except the first) is to put the blame on their mental powers, rather than on the inadequacy of their knowledge of the subject matter, or how math works, or both. Try not to fall into this trap, mathematics is not reserved for mentally privileged people.</p>

<p>Let’s try to discover what we DON’T know that is preventing us from seeing the logic behind the divisibility rule for 3. First, do we really know the rule? The rule is actually not that “a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3”, but rather “a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits in the decimal representation of it is divisible by 3”. There is no possibility of progress without, explicitly or implicitly, being aware of this nuance. Rule is stated to hold for decimal representation, so the reason why it holds must have something to do with the decimal representation. Do we know, then, what does decimal representation, or even representation, mean for numbers?</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox theorem" id="thm:base-representation">
  <p><strong>Theorem</strong> (base representation) <br /><br />
Given any integer \(n &gt; 0\) and any base \(b \geq 2\), there exist unique integers \(d_0, d_1, \ldots, d_k\) all non-negative and less than \(b\) with \(d_k&gt;0\) such that <br /><br /> \(n = d_k b^k + d_{k-1} b^{k-1} + \ldots + d_1 b^1 + d_0 b^0\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, \(5097= 5\cdot10^3 + 0\cdot 10^2 + 9\cdot 10^1 + 7\cdot 10^0\), where the base is 10, and the digits are 5,0,9, and 7.</p>

<p>Let’s go back to divisibility by 3. When we write a number in this form, we immediately see that the base terms \(10^i\) except when \(i=0\) are irrelevant for divisibility by 3, you can just ignore them. Why?</p>

<p>Let’s go on trying to discover some other potential gaps in our knowledge and understanding. What is divisibility by 3? If \(3 \mid n\), then there exists an integer \(k\) such that \(n = 3k\). Is there an alternative expression of this state of affairs that would be more useful to us? What about \(n\bmod 3 = 0\). When we are invited to check whether \(3\mid 5097\), we are actually checking whether \(5097 \bmod 3 = 0\). Can we express ‘\(5097 \bmod 3\)’ in terms of 5097’s digits?</p>

<p>For a moment forget about digits. Assume we are asked to find whether 7 is divisible by 3. What do we do? We compute \(7 \bmod 3\) and discover that it is not zero, and answer ‘No’ to the question. What about 3 dividing 17? You would start computing \(17 \bmod 3\) right away, but can’t you also use the result of an earlier computation? (Imagine yourself in a situation where you are asked ‘\(7873298475 \bmod 42\)’ and you know the result for ‘\(7873298400 \bmod 42\)’, wouldn’t it be nice to get away by computing only ‘\(75 \bmod 42\)’ and recycle your earlier result?) Why not, for example, say that \(7\bmod 3=1\) and \(10 \bmod 3= 1\), so \(17\bmod 3\) must be their sum 2, which indeed is \(17\bmod 3\). Can I generalize this? Can I say that given two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), \((a + b) \bmod 3 = a \bmod 3 + b \bmod 3\)? This doesn’t work, because if both \(a \bmod 3\) and \(b \bmod 3\) equal 2, their sum is 4, which is not a valid value for \(\bmod 3\) – for instance \((8 + 11)\bmod 3\neq (8\bmod 3) + (11\bmod 3)\). But observe that applying \(\bmod 3\) to the result, 4 in this case, will give you the right result. In other words, our specific example obeys the following template \((a + b) \bmod 3 = ((a \bmod 3) + (b \bmod 3)) \bmod 3\)? Does this hold generally? For all \(m&gt;0\)? Yes, it does. Let us state this as a theorem<sup id="fnref:modadd" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:modadd" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and prove it.</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox theorem" id="thm:modular-addition">

<blockquote class="mathbox proof" id="proof:modular-addition">

Let \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(m \in \mathbb{Z}^+\).<br />

We know that \(r_1,r_2&lt; m\), by the definition of the remainder in the Division Algorithm.<br />
Therefore, \(r_1-r_2\) cannot be equal to or greater than \(m\) and cannot be less than or equal to \(-m\), i.e.  \(-m &lt; r_1 - r_2 &lt; m\).<br />
The only way this condition holds is when \(q+s+t-p\), an integer, is equal to 0, which means \(r_1 = r_2\).<br /></p>

<p>The proof, which is similar to the above, is left as an exercise.</p>

<p>Where are we now on divisibility by 3? We now know that whenever we are asked about ‘\(10n\bmod 3\)’ we can answer that it is ‘\(n\bmod 3\)’, because we know that:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
10n\bmod 3 &amp;=&amp; ((10 \bmod 3)(n\bmod 3)) \bmod 3 \\
&amp;=&amp;(n\bmod 3) \bmod 3\\
&amp;=&amp;n\bmod 3
\end{align*}\]

<p>By the iterated application of this logic, you can have in general:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox lemma" id="lemma:powers-of-10-mod-3">
  <p><strong>Lemma</strong> (powers of 10 mod 3) <br /><br />

</blockquote>

<p>We are all set in terms of building blocks. Let’s combine them all:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox lemma" id="lemma:sum-of-digits-mod-3">
  <p><strong>Lemma</strong> (sum of digits mod 3) <br /><br />

\(n \bmod 3 = (d_k10^k + d_{k-1}10^{k-1} \ldots d_110^1 + d_010^0) \bmod 3\)<br />

<p>It’s been a long day, I know. But one final example. One that, like the above, trades on some property of number 3. Here is a claim about prime numbers that we need to check:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox claim" id="claim:3-primes">
  <p><strong>Claim</strong> (3 consecutive primes) <br /><br />
3, 5, and 7 are three consecutive prime numbers, in the sense that there is no odd composite number intervening. There is no other triple of consecutive prime numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are the following strategies to approach these types of statements.</p>
<ol>
  <li>You find an instance that contradicts the claim. In this case a triple of consecutive primes other than 3,5,7.</li>
  <li>You assume that there exists such a triple other than 3,5,7, and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.</li>
  <li>You pick an arbitrary triple of consecutive primes, where all you are entitled to know that (i) they are primes, (ii) they are consecutive in the Claim’s sense, and (ii) the first of them is not 3. You convince the reader that the triple you picked cannot be all primes, which amounts to showing that  <em>any</em>  triple other than 3,5,7 is guaranteed NOT to be all prime, proving the claim.</li>
</ol>

<p>This particular claim gives itself to the third strategy.</p>

<p>Think and try before I give you a clue.</p>

<p>Clue 1: The claim states that there cannot be any integer \(p\neq 3\) such that \(p, p+2, p+4\) are all prime. Make sure you understand the conditions of the problem.</p>

<p>Think and try before I give you another clue.</p>

<p>Clue 2: You can show any such triple other than 3,5,7 must include a number divisible by 3.</p>

<p>Think and try before I give you the final clue.</p>

<p>Clue 3: Concentrate on \(p \bmod 3\).</p>

<p>Think and try before you look at the proof.</p>

<p>Here is the proof, which concludes this post:</p>

<blockquote class="mathbox proof" id="proof:3-primes">
  <p><strong>Proof</strong> (Claim 3 consecutive primes)<br /><br />
Let \(p, p+2, p+4\) be any three consecutive odd numbers with \(p \geq 5\).<br />
Either \(3\mid p\) or \(3\nmid p\).<br />
If \(3\mid p\), then \(p\) is composite, the triple cannot be all primes.<br />
else if \(3\nmid p\) then either \(p \bmod 3=1\) or \(p\bmod 3 = 2\). <br />
If \(p\bmod 3=1\), then \((p+2) \bmod 3 = 0\), which means \(3\mid (p+2)\), and therefore \(p+2\) is composite.<br />
If \(p\bmod 3=2\), then \((p+4) \bmod 3 = 0\), which means \(3\mid (p+4)\), and therefore \(p+4\) is composite.<br />
Simply there is no way that a triple other than 3,5,7 can be all primes.</p>

<p>Remember our principle “do one thing at a time”. Does it hold for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">largest_collatz</code>? What was our test? We ask ourselves  does this function have parts that might be useful for other tasks? The function enters into a loop, has a specific way to get the next item in the sequence, and keeps track of the largest number seen so far. This appears to be a task we might want to perform for other sequences as well. For example, we could have the task to find the largest number in the <strong>aliquot sequence</strong> (read “AL-i-kwot”) of a number, where the next number in the sequence is obtained by summing the proper divisors of the current number.<sup id="fnref:aliquot" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:aliquot" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Like Collatz sequences, aliquot sequences also can fluctuate.<sup id="fnref:fluc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fluc" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Assume, although wrongly, that an aliquot sequence always ends at 1.</p>

<p>If our task was to find the largest number in an aliquot sequence, what would have changed in the above code? Just a single name! We would have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aliquot</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collatz</code>, where the former would be the name of the function that computes the next number in the aliquot sequence. This shows that we can separate (1) the task of finding the largest number in a sequence from (2) the task of computing the next number in that sequence.</p>

<p>The function that computes the next aliquot number is an exercise you need to tackle. But let’s assume we already have a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">next_aliquot</code>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">next_aliquot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>

    """</span>
    <span class="c1"># Assume the function is properly defined and usable 
</span>    <span class="k">pass</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You are about to pass a milestone in your programming journey, read carefully. To separate the task of finding the largest in a sequence from the choice of a particular sequence, we abstract the sequence function from our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">largest_collatz</code> function. This is done by replacing the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collatz</code> in our function with the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequencer</code> (any name will be fine) and make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequencer</code> a parameter of our function. Here is how:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">largest_in_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">):</span>

    16
    &gt;&gt;&gt; largest_in_sequence(12, next_aliquot)
    16
    &gt;&gt;&gt; largest_in_sequence(15, next_aliquot)
    9
    """</span>
    <span class="n">largest_so_far</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">n</span>

        <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">largest_so_far</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">largest_so_far</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">n</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">largest_so_far</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course we no longer call our function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">largest_collatz</code>. With this function, you can now find the largest number in <em>any</em> sequence defined by a function that computes the next number in that sequence. You just need to pass the appropriate function as the second argument. If you want to find the largest number in a Collatz sequence seeded by 183, call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">largest_in_sequence(183, collatz)</code>, if you are interested in the largest number in an aliquot sequence seeded by the same number, call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">largest_in_sequence(183, next_aliquot)</code>.</p>

<p>There is big lie in the above paragraph. What is it?</p>

<p>Our function would work fine with Collatz sequences, and with <em>some</em> aliquot sequences, but not with <em>any</em> sequence. Because our function assumes that the sequence ends in 1. This does not have to be so in the general case. We have to free ourselves from that 1, you might think. And for someone who has started abstracting functions, abstracting a number should not be a problem: simply add a third parameter for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stop_value</code>:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">largest_in_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">stop_value</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""Return the largest number in the sequence seeded by n using sequencer function. """</span>
    <span class="n">largest_so_far</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">n</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">largest_so_far</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Seems OK. But is it?</p>

<p>What if I wanted to stop when a number in my sequence becomes odd, prime or, say, one of the prime factors of 38592? These cases cannot be handled by passing a number to my function to be inserted to the right of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!=</code>. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Once again I need a more general, more abstract way to handle the problem. Why don’t I use a function parameter again, this time named, say,  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alive</code>, which when applied to my iteration parameter \(n\) returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> if I need to continue, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code> if I need to stop? Here is the updated code:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">largest_in_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">alive</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">largest_so_far</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">largest_so_far</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now with this function and the function below:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">not_div_7_3</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I can find the largest number in the Collatz sequence seeded by 1000 that is encountered before we reach a number divisible by both 3 and 7, with the following call:<sup id="fnref:silly" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:silly" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">largest_in_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">collatz</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">div_7_3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, we already have gone a long way. Is it time to rest? One final check: Look again at our latest <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">largest_in_sequence</code> function. Does it do “one thing only”? Take your time; but you know, if it did, I wouldn’t ask this question.</p>

<p>It doesn’t. There is still room for abstraction. Again it might not be easy to see, but use our test: Does this function have parts that might be useful for other tasks? What would you need to change in this function if the task was to find the <em>smallest</em> number in a sequence rather than the largest? You might, rightly, think finding the smallest does not make sense in Collatz – why is that by the way?  But assume the task is to find not the largest or smallest number in the sequence, but the number with the largest or smallest sum of digits. What would change in the code?
Please think before proceeding. Try to come up with your own modification.</p>

<p>Here is another abstraction, this time the comparison bit has been abstracted into a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beats</code>, which when applied to two numbers returns True, if the first number is “better” than the second according to some criterion, and False otherwise. Here is the final code:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">best_in_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">alive</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">beats</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""Return the 'best' number according to beats in the sequence seeded by n using sequencer function. """</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">best_so_far</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assume you want to find the largest number in the Collatz sequence seeded by 176 whose sum of digits is even. Assuming you already solved the exercise of writing a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sum_of_digits</code> that computes the sum of digits of a number, all you need is to define the following two functions:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">beats</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""Check whether x is greater than y and its sum of digits is even."""</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">sum_of_digits</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">y</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

<p>and call:</p>

<p>A couple of notes are in order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The reason I defined the functions we will send as parameters to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">best_in_sequence</code> with the names <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alive</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beats</code> is just that I couldn’t think of better names. You can name them whatever you like. In this current form, they are totally different from the same names we used in the definition of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">best_in_sequence</code>. If this point is not perfectly clear to you, please ask me about it.</li>
  <li>When we say “do one thing at a time”, we do not rule out functions like our final <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beats</code> function that do two things: compare two numbers and apply a criterion (like sum of digits even). This is because such functions are small enough and focused enough to be considered as doing one thing. There is no general use of parts of it for other tasks.</li>
  <li>Our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alive</code> seems a little idiotic to define, after all it just checks whether a number is not equal to 1. We have to do it in this ugly way for some time until we learn about lambda functions. When that shiny day arrives, the call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">best_in_sequence</code> would look like this:
    <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">best_in_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">176</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">collatz</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">!=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">sum_of_digits</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>and we will not have to define these small functions separately.</p>

<p>Well. Does the final version of our function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">best_in_sequence</code> obey our principle “do one thing at a time”?</p>

<p>It very persuasively stands to be obeying the principle. One might say that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">best_in_sequence</code> does one thing: find the best item in a given sequence using a given criterion. Incidentally, note that the sequence is not <em>passed</em> to our function as a single object but came in three pieces, namely the seed (or start), the sequencer function, and the alive function, which tells when the sequence ends. No harm for now, we promised to abstract away the source part, we didn’t promise that we will do it as a single parameter abstraction.</p>

<p>Let’s turn back to our question of whether <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">best_in_sequence</code> affords further abstractions. All we need is to apply our test and ask:  do we listen to sources only to pick the best item according to some criterion? Or can there be other reasons why we listen to a source? What if we were asked to take the sum of all the integers encountered in reducing a seed to 1 by Collatz function? This is a slightly different problem than above, but cannot be solved by our function. We need a new function, perhaps something like this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sum_in_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">alive</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""Return the sum of numbers in the sequence seeded by n using sequencer function. """</span>
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">alive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">n</span>
        <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">total</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What if we wanted the product of the numbers in the sequence? Mean? Geometric mean? Would you write separate functions for each? You can of course, but you should not, actually you <em>need</em> not. Let’s first get rid of our dependence on the particular summation business. We will have a store (or accumulator) that we will update at each turn of our loop, and the update will be done by a function, passed as a parameter, that will apply to the current item in the sequence <em>and</em> the current value of the store.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">accumulate_in_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">alive</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""Return the accumulated value in the sequence seeded by n using sequencer function. """</span>
    <span class="n">acc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">alive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">acc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">acc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">acc</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now if you want to add numbers in a Collatz sequence, have your update function and other parameters ready. Write the update function before proceeding.<sup id="fnref:add" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:add" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">acc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">item</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="s">"""Return the sum of acc and item."""</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">acc</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">item</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_alive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="s">"""Return True if n is not 1."""</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">collatz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="s">"""Return the next number in the Collatz sequence."""</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">//</span> <span class="mi">2</span>

      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and call your function like this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">accumulate_in_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">collatz</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">is_alive</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">add</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What if you want to find the largest number in the sequence? Is it doable with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">accumulate_in_sequence</code>? Or do you need to use the good old <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">best_in_sequence</code>? Think.</p>

<p>It is perfectly doable, even fun to do. You do not even need to write a new update function. Simply pass Python’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max</code>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">accumulate_in_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">collatz</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">is_alive</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">max</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One final touch, in case it escaped your eye till now: our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">accumulate_in_sequence</code> function initializes the store to 0. This is fine for summation, but not for other tasks. Make the initial state of your store a parameter. Here is the final version, with a more general name for processing sequences:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">proc_seq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">alive</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">init</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""Return the accumulated value in the sequence seeded by n using sequencer function. """</span>
    <span class="n">store</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">init</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">alive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">store</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">store</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sequencer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">store</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is an important question that you can use to test your understanding of what is going on here, I mean regarding higher order functions and abstraction: How would you, now, solve the problem of finding the largest positive integer \(n\) with the largest Collatz length s.t. \(1 &lt; n &lt; k\) for a given \(k\)? I give you 1000 (\(k\)) and you return me the largest positive smaller integer with a Collatz length not smaller than any other you can find in the range from 1 to 1000.</p>

<p>With the power of higher-order functions, we gradually formed a general purpose, highly abstract function that can be used in an enormous variety of computational tasks.</p>

<p>There will surely be complaints about having a five parameter function. Given its power, five is not bad at all, but you can reduce it for most cases by keyword parameters, which is a topic for another day.</p>

\[C(n) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{n}{2} &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even}\\
3n + 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
\end{cases}\]

<p><strong>Collatz’ conjecture</strong> states that for any positive integer \(n\), repeated application of \(C\) will eventually reach 1.
The <strong>Collatz sequence</strong> of a given positive integer \(n\) is the sequence of numbers obtained by repeatedly applying \(C\) starting from \(n\) until reaching 1. We will call \(n\) the <strong>seed</strong> of the sequence, and also use phrases like “a (Collatz) sequence seeded by \(n\)”, and so on. When we talk about the Collatz sequence of a number, we will include the starting number and the ending 1 in the sequence, this is good because by looking at the sequence, you immediately see how it started and that it is completed. Finally, we will use the phrase
“Collatz sequence seeded by \(n\)” to refer to the Collatz sequence generated to reduce \(n\) to 1.</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><strong>Check:</strong> Write the Collatz sequence seeded by 11.</p>

<p>One can be interested in many questions about Collatz sequence. For one:</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Question:</strong> Given an upper bound \(k \geq 1\), find the seed \(n \leq k\) that produces the longest Collatz sequence.</p>

<p>The first question to ask about a programming problem is what are the inputs and outputs of the function we want to write. Here, the input is a positive integer \(k\), and the output is another positive integer \(n \leq k\) that produces the longest Collatz sequence among all integers from 1 to \(k\).</p>

<p>Once this global input-output relation is clear, the next step is to think about how to break this relation into smaller parts, or simpler problems that we can solve one by one to reach the final solution. At this point, a strategy that works quite well in most cases is to ask “What do I have to be able to do in order to solve this problem?”</p>

<p>Let’s list:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Given a seed \(n\), we need to be able to compute the Collatz sequence seeded by \(n\).</li>
  <li>We need to be able to compute the length of a given sequence.</li>
  <li>We need to be able to compare lengths of multiple sequences and come up with the longest sequence.</li>
  <li>Finding the longest sequence is not enough, we also need to remember the seed that produced that sequence.</li>
</ol>

<p>We can start with the first one. What is the input-output relation for this subproblem? Input is a positive  integer \(n\), and output is the Collatz sequence seeded by \(n\), which is a list (or sequence) of integers. We have a problem here since we do not know yet constructing lists in Python. But we can at least print the numbers in the Collatz sequence one by one. Here is how we can do that using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">while</code> loop:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_collatz_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># Print the last element of the sequence
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is a very important principle in good programming that we need to follow as tightly as we can:</p>

<p class="notice--success"><strong>Principle:</strong> Each function should do one thing.</p>

<p>Think for a moment whether <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print_collatz_sequence</code> follows this principle. It might appear to be so. But actually, it does two things. It computes the Collatz function for numbers within a loop, and it prints the numbers. That there are two separable tasks might not be obvious to you for the moment, but here is a simple test: What if we wanted to add the numbers in a Collatz sequence rather than print them on screen? That code would be very similar to the one we wrote. There would be the exact same or very similar lines for computing the next number in the sequence. The following bit:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>   <span class="c1"># checks whether n is even
</span>    <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">//</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only difference would be that instead of printing the number, we would add it to a running total. This shows that our function is doing two things: computing the next number in the sequence, and printing it. Here is a useful principle:</p>

<p class="notice--success"><strong>Principle:</strong> Examining the function you wrote, if you discover blocks of code (like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement above) that might be useful for other tasks as well, separate that block into another function and use that function instead of the block.</p>

<p>In our example, this principle dictates us to write a separate function to apply the Collatz function:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">collatz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>

    -4
    """</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="mi">2</span>     <span class="c1"># // instead of / for an integer result

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and handle the printing of the sequence with:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_collatz_sequence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>What we actually want is the length of the sequence, not its display on the screen. To get the length we will have to violate our principle of doing one thing at a time in a function. But this is only a temporary thing, once we learn how to form the sequences themselves, rather than their prints on the screen, we will get back to our principle. For now, counting has to be done like this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">collatz_length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">counter</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We seem to have all the ingredients we need to solve our original problem. But let’s do not rush. Let’s try to abstract a little away from our problem. The problem can be thought as a composition of two components:
    1. There is a <strong>message source</strong> that generates numbers in order. You can also think of it as a stream, or a channel.
    1. There is a <strong>listener</strong> (or <strong>receiver</strong>) that listens to the channel and keeps the record of the largest number received so far.</p>

<p>The generating source can vary from problem to problem, but the listener has a more general character. For example, the source could have been random integers between, say 1 and 1000000 (a million), and assume we were asked to find the largest such integer in \(k\) random integers. The code would look like:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">largest_random</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>The function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">randint</code> is imported from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random</code> module, and generates a random integer between the two arguments (inclusive).</p>

<p>If our problem were to find the largest length rather than the seed that yields the largest length, we would have a very similar function:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">largest_collatz_length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""The largest Collatz length for the seeds between 1 and k."""</span>
    <span class="n">largest_so_far</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">k</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">current_length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">collatz_length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">counter</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">current_length</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">largest_so_far</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">largest_so_far</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">current_length</span>
        <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">largest_so_far</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ours is a little more complicated than this. We need to remember the seed that produced the largest length as well. Here is the final code:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">maximal_collatz_seed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""The largest seed between 1 and k that produces the largest Collatz length."""</span>
    <span class="n">largest_length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="n">seed_with_largest_length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">k</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">current_length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">collatz_length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">counter</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">current_length</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">largest_length</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">largest_length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">current_length</span>
            <span class="n">seed_with_largest_length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">counter</span>
        <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">seed_with_largest_length</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once again we could not follow our principle of “one thing at a time” in the above function. The source component and listener component are fused together. In the earlier case we were helpless because we did not know how to construct sequences. If we knew we could have separated the construction and length components. The reason we are helpless in the current case is that we do not know about higher order functions – functions that take other functions as arguments. Once we learn about them, we will be able to separate the source and listener components.</p>

<p>Finally, notice that I wrote “The largest seed between 1 and k that produces the largest Collatz length” in the docstring. Why is that? Why did I say “the <em>largest</em> seed”?</p>]]></content><author><name>First Lastname</name></author><category term="course" /><category term="programming" /><category term="iteration" /><category term="while loop" /><category term="cogs501" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s start with a simple function defined over integers called the Collatz function \(C\).]]></summary></entry></feed>
