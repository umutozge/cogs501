Quiz 05 (18/3) - COGS 501/Spring 2024
------------------------------------

1. **[4/10]** The functions we have seen so far are _total_ functions in the
   sense that they associate each and every element in their domain with exactly
   one element in their codomain. A _partial_ function, on the other hand, may
   be undefined for _any_ number of elements in its domain.

   Given the sets $A$ and $B$, where $\|A\|=\|B\|=3$, how many partial functions are there
   from $A$ to $B$?

   Bonus (2pts): How many partial function are there from a set with $n$ elements to a set of $r$ elements?


    -----------------------

    **Solution:**

    We insert an element into the codomain to serve as the image of undefined members in the
    domain. Therefore, there are $(r+1)^n$ partial functions from an $n$
    element set to an $r$ element set.  $r^n$ of these are also total functions
    -- these do not map any element to the element we insert into the codomain
    for undefined images.

1. **[6/10]** An RNA sequence is a sequence of the letters A U C G. How many 4 letter RNA sequences are there which:
   <ol type='a'>
        <li> use only A, G and U? </li>
        <li> does NOT contain the sequense CAG. (Sequence CAG means the letters are consequtive wihtout any other letter intervening.)</li>
        <li> do not contain all four bases?</li>
        <li> contains exactly two of the four bases?</li>
   </ol>

   -------------------------

   **Answers**

   <ol type='a'>
        <li> $3^4$ </li>
        <li> $4^4 - 2\cdot 4$</li>
        <li> $4^4 - 4!$ </li>
        <li> $\binom{4}{2}\cdot 2^4$</li>
   </ol>
