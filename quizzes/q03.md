Quiz (16/10) - COGS 501
------------------------------------

1. **[4pts]** Below is a program fragment that reads a sentence from the console and prints a message regarding whether there are more consonants or vowels in the input. Assume that the vowels are limited to `aeiou`, but beware that there may be characters that are not alphabetical in the input. You need to ignore these while counting. You can use the string method `isalpha` to do this. (Given that `x` holds a string, `x.isalpha()` will evaluate to `True` if `x` consists only of alphabetical characters and to `False` otherwise. )

    ```python
    sent = input("Enter a sentence: ") 

    cons = 0
    vow = 0

    for c in sent:
        # YOUR CODE HERE






    if # YOUR CODE HERE 
        print("More consonants.")
    else:
        print("More vowels.")
    ```

    **Solution:**
    ```python
    sent = input("Enter a sentence: ")

    cons = 0
    vow = 0

    for c in sent:
        if c.isalpha():
            if c in "aeiou":
                vow = vow + 1
            else:
                cons = cons + 1

    if vow > cons:
        print("More consonants.")
    else:
        print("More vowels.")
    ```

2. **[2pts]** What will be printed by the following program if the user enters `5` for the prompt:

    ```python
    n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))

    while n != 1:
        print(int(n))
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n/2
        else:
            n = 3*n + 1

    print("You're all set.")
    ```

    **Solution:**
    ```python
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    You're all set.
    ```
