Checklist
---------

* Create a file `words.txt` which contains a word per line, around 10 to 15
    lines.
* Adopt the program in Ch. 1 so that when the file `words.txt` is given as
    input, your program calculates the average word lenght in the file. Use the function `len`, which takes as input a string and returns an integer, the number of characters in the string.
