Quiz 04 (11/3) - COGS 501/Spring 2024
------------------------------------

1. **[3/10]** Given a set $A$ and two functions $f, g \subset A\times A$.
If you are told that $f\cup g$ is also a function, what did you learn now about
$f$ and $g$?


1. **[3/10]** There are two-faced cards with a number on one face and a letter on the
   other. You are given the rule:  If a card has an even number on one face, it
   must have a consonant on the other. Four cards are laid on a table showing the faces
   `A K 4 7`. Which card or card(s) would you turn over to test whether the rule
   is followed or not?


1. **[4/10]** Given relations $R \subseteq A\times B$ and $S \subseteq B\times
   C$. Then the composite relation $S\circ R$ is the relation consisting of all
   ordered pairs of the form $(a, c)$, where $(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, c) \in S$.
   If $A = \\{p, q, r, s\\}$, $B = \\{a, b\\}$, $C = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, $R = \\{(p, a), (p,
   b), (q, b), (r, a), (s, a)\\}$ and $S = \\{(a, 1), (a, 2), (b, 4)\\}$, find $S\circ
   R$.
