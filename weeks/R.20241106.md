#### Reading
* Stavely, Sections 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.3

#### Checklist 

* Define a `lambda` function that takes two integers and returns the one that is
    not less than the other.
* Define a `lambda` function that takes two integers and returns `None` if they
    are equal, and the larger one otherwise.
* Define a `lambda` function that takes a 2-tuple and returns the reversed
    2-tuple.
* Write a program that takes a positive integer as input and returns the Collatz
    sequence seeded by this integer. The resulting sequence must start with the
    seed and end with 1.
* Construct the sequence in the reverse order, first 1, last seed. Don't use a
    reversing operation over the result, construct the sequence in the reverse
    order.
* Solve the last two problems with recursion. This may appear hard, but try to do
    your best.
