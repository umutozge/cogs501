### Math:

* Read Section 1.6 and 1.7 (Levin).
* Anxiolytic: Be prepared for a quiz that may cover all the counting methods and
  problems we have dealt so far. There will be no programming reading or
  assignment. This is a good opportunity to catch up with the rest of the class
  in counting. If you cannot grasp the fundamentals of counting, you will suffer
  a lot in probability.
