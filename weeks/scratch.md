Schwarzschild's null hypothesis (p. 290): indefinites are standard
existential quantitifiers bound by the standard scope taking
restrictions with implicit domain restriction. I raise two issues with
this hypothesis:

1. In Turkish special indefinites formally differ from standard
   indefinites. Therefore, the exceptional scope taking behavior
   cannot be due to an operation that works behind the scenes like
   implicit domain restriction. An indefinite is never ambiguous
   regarding the status of its exceptional abilities.
1. Implicit domain restriction is available for zero-indefinites as
   well. When we say `John bir hata gorurse, makaleyi reddeder.` the
   restrictor of the indefinite is implicitely narrowed down to
   `errors in the article under discussion`. There is no reason for
   this implicit domain restriction not to zoom down to a singleton
   set, were it the case that exceptional behavior is due to the
   limit cases of implicit domain restriction.[^1]  


   [^1]: Another question that I will not dwell on here is why the
   limiting case of implicit domain restriction is not the emptyset
   but a singleton set.
