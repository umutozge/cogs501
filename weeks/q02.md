##### Quiz 02 (26/2) -- COGS 501/Spring 2024


1. Given an integer $n > 2$ , let $P$ stand for the proposition that $n$ is odd,
and $Q$ stand for the proposition that $n$ is prime. Which of the following is true?[^1]

<ol type="a">
  <li>$P$ is necessary for $Q$</li>
  <li>$Q$ is necessary for $P$</li>
  <li>$P$ is sufficient for $Q$</li>
  <li>$Q$ is sufficient for $P$</li>
</ol>




[^1]: A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. (Wikipedia)


2. Express the choices of the previous question in logical notation (i.e. $P\rightarrow Q$, etc.)



2. What does the following definition do?

```racket
(define (foo x y)
    (* x y))

```
