1. <s>**[2pts]**</s> (cancelled) Find the second largest integer in a list of integers using `reduce`.

2. **[2pts]** You will take as input one-argument function `f` and two equal sized sequences of integers `seq1` and `seq2`. You will return a sequence of integers of the same size as `seq1` and `seq2` such that each position of the result sequence is occupied by the element at the same position from `seq1` or `seq2` depending on which of them gives a higher value for `f`.
