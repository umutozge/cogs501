`Quiz - 27/11 - COGS 501`
-------------------------
1. **[2pts]** The function `bubble` takes an integer `n` and a sequence `seq` of integers and inserts `n` into `seq` at the furthest possible position where there is no integer that is greater than `n` before it. Assume you have `bubble` defined. Use it and `reduce` to sort a given sequence of integers.

2. **[2pts]** Define your own version of `filter` which returns a boolean mask rather than the filtered list. E.g.:

```python
>>> filter_boolean_mask(lambda x: x > 2, [1,2,4,2,4,4])
[False, False, True, False, True, True]
```

3. ðŸ¤‘ **[1pt]** You get this bonus if you solve the above problem without using
   any statements.
