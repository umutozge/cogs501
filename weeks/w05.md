#### Reading
* No reading, just coding..

#### Checklist 

* Remember that when you are asked to write a function, nothing should prevent
    you to write other functions that are used by the function you are asked to
    write.
* Write a function that computes the factorial of a non-negative integer using a
    `for` loop.
* Write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and returns the number of
    times when the product of the two consecutive numbers in the Collatz chain
    seeded by `n` exceeds `n**2`.
* Write a function `appl` that takes the following three arguments:
    ```
    func: a function that takes 1 argument
    arg: an argument to func
    count: the number of times func must be applied.
    ```
    and returns the result of applying `func` to `arg` and then the result for
    `count` times.

    Here is an example interaction:
    ```
    >>> sqr = lambda x:x**2
    >>> appl(sqr,2,3)
    256
    >>>
    ```
* Write a function `applier` that takes a one-argument function `func` a
    positive integer `count` and returns a one-argument function such that when
    given its argument it applies to the argument `count` times in the above
    fashion.
    ```
    >>> sqr = lambda x:x**2
    >>> foo = applier(sqr,3)
    >>> foo(2)
    256
    >>>
    ```
* Make sure you know the input and output types of your functions.
